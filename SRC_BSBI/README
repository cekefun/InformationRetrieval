run 'make' to build the indexer(bsbi) and the printer.

Running the indexer on every file in the data directory:
    ./bsbi data/*
This will create a new directory with all the blocks and the final 'index' and 'terms' file.

To print the content of the index:
    ./printer <directory that contains the index>
