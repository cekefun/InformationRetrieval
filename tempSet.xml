His famous quote on the matter is "Liberty is the mother, not the daughter, of order". In ''What is Property?'' Proudhon answers with the famous accusation "[[Property is theft]]."

As for the reforms initiated by the Commune, such as the re-opening of workplaces as co-operatives, anarchists can see their ideas of associated labour beginning to be realised&nbsp;... Moreover, the Commune's ideas on federation obviously reflected the influence of Proudhon on French radical ideas. Indeed, the Commune's vision of a communal France based on a federation of delegates bound by imperative mandates issued by their electors and subject to recall at any moment echoes Bakunin's and Proudhon's ideas (Proudhon, like Bakunin, had argued in favour of the "implementation of the binding mandate" in 1848&nbsp;... and for federation of communes).

The dismemberment of the French [[socialist movement]], into many groups and, following the suppression of the 1871 Paris Commune, the execution and exile of many ''[[communards]]'' to [[penal colonies]], favoured individualist political expression and acts.<ref>Historian [[Benedict Anderson]] thus writes: <blockquote> "In March 1871 the Commune took power in the abandoned city and held it for two months. Then [[Adolphe Thiers|Versailles]] seized the moment to attack and, in one horrifying week, executed roughly 20,000 Communards or suspected sympathizers, a number higher than those killed in the recent war or during [[Robespierre]]'s '[[Reign of Terror|Terror]]' of 1793–1794. More than 7,500 were jailed or deported to places like New Caledonia. Thousands of others fled to Belgium, England, Italy, Spain and the United States. In 1872, stringent laws were passed that ruled out all possibilities of organising on the left. Not till 1880 was there a general amnesty for exiled and imprisoned Communards. Meanwhile, the Third Republic found itself strong enough to renew and reinforce [[Napoleon III of France|Louis Napoleon]]'s imperialist expansion – in Indochina, Africa, and Oceania. Many of France's leading intellectuals and artists had participated in the Commune ([[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]] was its quasi-minister of culture, [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]] and [[Pissarro]] were active propagandists) or were sympathetic to it. The ferocious repression of 1871 and thereafter, was probably the key factor in alienating these milieux from the Third Republic and stirring their sympathy for its victims at home and abroad." {{Cite journal | last = Anderson | first = Benedict | author-link = Benedict Anderson | title = In the World-Shadow of Bismarck and Nobel | journal = [[New Left Review]] | volume = II | issue = 28 | pages = 85–129 | publisher = New Left Review | date = July–August 2004 | url = http://newleftreview.org/II/28/benedict-anderson-in-the-world-shadow-of-bismarck-and-nobel | ref = harv | postscript = .| access-date = 2016-01-07 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151219130121/http://newleftreview.org/II/28/benedict-anderson-in-the-world-shadow-of-bismarck-and-nobel | archive-date = 2015-12-19 }} </blockquote> According to some analysts, in [[History of Germany since 1945|post-war Germany]], the prohibition of the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]] (KDP) and thus of institutional far-left political organization may also, in the same manner, have played a role in the creation of the [[Red Army Faction]].</ref> Numerous heads of state were assassinated between 1881 and 1914 by members of the anarchist movement, including Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia]], President [[Marie François Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] of France, [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria]], King [[Umberto I of Italy]], President [[William McKinley]] of the United States, King [[Carlos I of Portugal]] and King [[George I of Greece]].

'Political Theorists in Context' Routledge (2004) p. 248</ref> Anarcho-syndicalists view labour unions as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically self-managed by workers. The basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are: Workers' [[wikt:Solidarity|solidarity]], [[Direct action]] and [[Workers' self-management]] Anarcho-syndicalists believe that only direct action&nbsp;— that is, action concentrated on directly attaining a goal, as opposed to indirect action, such as electing a representative to a government position – will allow workers to liberate themselves.<ref>Rocker, Rudolf. 'Anarcho-Syndicalism: Theory and Practice' AK Press (2004) p. 73</ref> Moreover, anarcho-syndicalists believe that workers' organisations (the organisations that struggle against the wage system, which, in anarcho-syndicalist theory, will eventually form the basis of a new society) should be self-managing. They should not have bosses or "business agents"; rather, the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves. Rudolf Rocker was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho-syndicalist movement. He outlined a view of the origins of the movement, what it sought, and why it was important to the future of labour in his 1938 pamphlet ''Anarcho-Syndicalism''. The International Workers Association is an international anarcho-syndicalist federation of various labour unions from different countries. The Spanish Confederación Nacional del Trabajo played and still plays a major role in the Spanish labour movement.

It generally views [[patriarchy]] as a manifestation of involuntary coercive hierarchy that should be replaced by [[decentralised]] free association. Anarcha-feminists believe that the struggle against patriarchy is an essential part of [[class struggle]], and the anarchist struggle against the state. In essence, the philosophy sees anarchist struggle as a necessary component of feminist struggle and vice versa. [[L. Susan Brown]] claims that "as anarchism is a political philosophy that opposes all relationships of power, it is inherently feminist".<ref>Brown, p. 208.</ref> Anarcha-feminism began with the late 19th-century writings of early feminist anarchists such as Emma Goldman and [[Voltairine de Cleyre]].

{{Redirect2|π|ϖ|the Greek letter|Pi (letter)|other uses|Pi (disambiguation)}} {{pp-protect|small=yes}} {{Use dmy dates|date=July 2012}} {{Pi box}} The number '''{{pi}}''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|aɪ}}) is a [[mathematical constant]]. Originally defined as the [[ratio]] of a [[circle]]'s [[circumference]] to its [[diameter]], it now has various equivalent definitions and appears in many formulas in all areas of [[mathematics]] and [[physics]]. It is approximately equal to 3.14159. It has been represented by the Greek letter "{{pi}}" since the mid-18th century, though it is also sometimes spelled out as "'''pi'''". Being an [[irrational number]], {{pi}} cannot be expressed exactly as a [[common fraction]] (equivalently, its [[decimal representation]] never ends and never [[repeating decimal|settles into a permanent repeating pattern]]). Still, fractions such as 22/7 and other rational numbers are commonly used to [[Approximations of π|approximate]] {{pi}}. The digits appear to be [[random sequence|randomly distributed]]. In particular, the digit sequence of {{pi}} is conjectured to satisfy a [[normal number|specific kind of statistical randomness]], but to date no proof of this has been discovered. Also, {{pi}} is a [[transcendental number]]; that is, a number that is not the [[Root of a polynomial|root]] of any non-zero [[polynomial]] having [[Rational number|rational]] [[coefficient]]s. This transcendence of {{pi}} implies that it is impossible to solve the ancient challenge of [[squaring the circle]] with a [[Compass-and-straightedge construction|compass and straightedge]]. Ancient civilizations required fairly accurate computed values for {{pi}} for practical reasons. It was calculated to seven digits, using geometrical techniques, in [[History of mathematics#Chinese mathematics|Chinese mathematics]], and to about five digits in [[History of mathematics#Indian mathematics|Indian mathematics]] in the 5th century AD. The historically first exact formula for {{pi}}, based on [[Series (mathematics)|infinite series]], was not available until a millennium later, when in the 14th century the [[Leibniz formula for pi|Madhava–Leibniz series]] was discovered in Indian mathematics.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Special Functions |first1=George E. |last1=Andrews |first2=Richard |last2=Askey |first3=Ranjan |last3=Roy |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1999|isbn=0-521-78988-5|page=58|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|first=R.

Because its most elementary definition relates to the circle, {{pi}} is found in many formulae in [[trigonometry]] and [[geometry]], especially those concerning circles, ellipses, and spheres. In more modern [[mathematical analysis]], the number is instead defined using the spectral properties of the [[real number]] system, as an [[eigenvalue]] or a [[periodic function|period]], without any reference to geometry. It appears therefore in areas of mathematics and the sciences having little to do with the geometry of circles, such as [[number theory]] and [[statistics]], as well as in almost all areas of [[physics]]. The ubiquity of {{pi}} makes it one of the most widely known mathematical constants both inside and outside the scientific community; several books devoted to it have been published, the number is celebrated on [[Pi Day]], and record-setting calculations of the digits of {{pi}} often result in news headlines. Attempts to memorize the value of {{pi}} with increasing precision have led to records of over 70,000 digits. {{TOC limit|limit=3}} ==Fundamentals== ===Name=== The symbol used by mathematicians to represent the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter is the lowercase [[Pi (letter)|Greek letter {{pi}}]], sometimes spelled out as ''pi,'' and derived from the first letter of the Greek word ''perimetros,'' meaning circumference.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Boeing |first=Niels |date=14 March 2016 |url=http://www.zeit.de/zeit-wissen/2016/02/pi-tag-mathematik-pi-kreiszahl |title=Die Welt ist Pi |trans-title=The World is Pi |language=de |journal=Zeit Online |quote=''Die Ludolphsche Zahl oder Kreiszahl erhielt nun auch das Symbol, unter dem wir es heute kennen: William Jones schlug 1706 den griechischen Buchstaben π vor, in Anlehnung an perimetros, griechisch für Umfang.

For example, if a circle has twice the diameter of another circle it will also have twice the circumference, preserving the ratio {{math|''C''/''d''}}. This definition of {{pi}} implicitly makes use of [[Euclidean geometry|flat (Euclidean) geometry]]; although the notion of a circle can be extended to any [[Non-Euclidean geometry|curved (non-Euclidean) geometry]], these new circles will no longer satisfy the formula {{math|{{pi}} {{=}} ''C''/''d''}}.<ref name="Arndt" /> Here, the circumference of a circle is the [[arc length]] around the perimeter of the circle, a quantity which can be formally defined independently of geometry using [[limit (mathematics)|limit]]s, a concept in [[calculus]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Tom |last=Apostol |authorlink=Tom Apostol |title=Calculus, volume 1 |publisher=Wiley |edition=2nd |year=1967}}.

See also {{harvnb|Reitwiesner|1950}}.</ref> The record, always relying on an arctan series, was broken repeatedly (7,480 digits in 1957; 10,000 digits in 1958; 100,000 digits in 1961) until 1 million digits were reached in 1973.<ref>{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|p=197}}</ref> Two additional developments around 1980 once again accelerated the ability to compute {{pi}}. First, the discovery of new [[iterative algorithm]]s for computing {{pi}}, which were much faster than the infinite series; and second, the invention of [[Multiplication algorithm#Fast multiplication algorithms for large inputs|fast multiplication algorithms]] that could multiply large numbers very rapidly.<ref>{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|pp=15–17}}</ref> Such algorithms are particularly important in modern {{pi}} computations, because most of the computer's time is devoted to multiplication.<ref>{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|pp=131}}</ref> They include the [[Karatsuba algorithm]], [[Toom–Cook multiplication]], and [[FFT multiplication#Fourier transform methods|Fourier transform-based methods]].<ref>{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|pp=132, 140}}</ref> The iterative algorithms were independently published in 1975–1976 by American physicist [[Eugene Salamin (mathematician)|Eugene Salamin]] and Australian scientist [[Richard Brent (scientist)|Richard Brent]].<ref name="Arndt_j">{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|p=87}}</ref> These avoid reliance on infinite series. An iterative algorithm repeats a specific calculation, each iteration using the outputs from prior steps as its inputs, and produces a result in each step that converges to the desired value. The approach was actually invented over 160 years earlier by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], in what is now termed the [[AGM method|arithmetic–geometric mean method]] (AGM method) or [[Gauss–Legendre algorithm]].<ref name="Arndt_j" /> As modified by Salamin and Brent, it is also referred to as the Brent–Salamin algorithm. The iterative algorithms were widely used after 1980 because they are faster than infinite series algorithms: whereas infinite series typically increase the number of correct digits additively in successive terms, iterative algorithms generally ''multiply'' the number of correct digits at each step. For example, the Brent-Salamin algorithm doubles the number of digits in each iteration. In 1984, the Canadian brothers [[Jonathan Borwein|John]] and [[Peter Borwein]] produced an iterative algorithm that quadruples the number of digits in each step; and in 1987, one that increases the number of digits five times in each step.<ref>{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|pp=111 (5 times); pp. 113–114 (4 times)}}.<br />See {{harvnb|Borwein|Borwein|1987}} for details of algorithms.</ref> Iterative methods were used by Japanese mathematician [[Yasumasa Kanada]] to set several records for computing {{pi}} between 1995 and 2002.<ref name="Background" /> This rapid convergence comes at a price: the iterative algorithms require significantly more memory than infinite series.<ref name="Background">{{cite web|last=Bailey|first=David H.|url=http://crd-legacy.lbl.gov/~dhbailey/dhbpapers/dhb-kanada.pdf|title=Some Background on Kanada's Recent Pi Calculation|date=16 May 2003|accessdate=12 April 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415102439/http://crd-legacy.lbl.gov/~dhbailey/dhbpapers/dhb-kanada.pdf|archivedate=15 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> ===Motives for computing {{pi}}=== [[File:Record pi approximations.svg|thumb|400px|right|As mathematicians discovered new algorithms, and computers became available, the number of known decimal digits of {{pi}} increased dramatically.

Below are some of the more common formulae that involve {{pi}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Bronshteĭn|Semendiaev|1971|pp=200, 209}}</ref> * The circumference of a circle with radius {{math|''r''}} is {{math|2π''r''}}. * The [[area of a disk|area of a circle]] with radius {{math|''r''}} is {{math|π''r''<sup>2</sup>}}. * The volume of a sphere with radius {{math|''r''}} is {{math|{{sfrac|4|3}}π''r''<sup>3</sup>}}. * The surface area of a sphere with radius {{math|''r''}} is {{math|4π''r''<sup>2</sup>}}. The formulae above are special cases of the volume of the [[N-ball|''n''-dimensional ball]] and the surface area of its boundary, the [[n-sphere|(''n''−1)-dimensional sphere]], given [[#Gamma function and Stirling's approximation|below]]. [[integral|Definite integrals]] that describe circumference, area, or volume of shapes generated by circles typically have values that involve {{pi}}. For example, an integral that specifies half the area of a circle of radius one is given by:<ref name="udi">{{MathWorld|Semicircle|Semicircle}}</ref> : <math>\int_{-1}^1 \sqrt{1-x^2}\,dx = \frac{\pi}{2}.</math> In that integral the function {{math|{{sqrt|1&nbsp;−&nbsp;''x''<sup>2</sup>}}}} represents the top half of a circle (the [[square root]] is a consequence of the [[Pythagorean theorem]]), and the integral {{math|{{intmath|int|−1|1}}}} computes the area between that half of a circle and the [[X axis|{{math|''x''}} axis]]. [[File:Sine cosine one period.svg|thumb|340px|alt=Diagram showing graphs of functions|[[Sine]] and [[cosine]] functions repeat with period 2{{pi}}.]] The [[trigonometric function]]s rely on angles, and mathematicians generally use radians as units of measurement. {{pi}} plays an important role in angles measured in [[radian]]s, which are defined so that a complete circle spans an angle of 2{{pi}} radians.<ref name="WR">{{harvnb|Ayers|1964|p=60}}</ref> The angle measure of 180° is equal to {{pi}} radians, and 1° = {{pi}}/180 radians.<ref name="WR" /> Common trigonometric functions have periods that are multiples of {{pi}}; for example, sine and cosine have period 2{{pi}},<ref name="WCS">{{harvnb|Bronshteĭn|Semendiaev|1971|pp=210–211}}</ref> so for any angle {{math|''θ''}} and any integer {{math|''k''}}, : <math> \sin\theta = \sin\left(\theta + 2\pi k \right) \text{ and } \cos\theta = \cos\left(\theta + 2\pi k \right).</math><ref name="WCS" /> ===Eigenvalues=== [[File:Harmonic_partials_on_strings.svg|thumb|right|The [[overtone]]s of a vibrating string are [[eigenfunction]]s of the second derivative, and form a [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic progression]]. The associated eigenvalues form the [[arithmetic progression]] of integer multiples of {{pi}}.]] Many of the appearances of {{pi}} in the formulas of mathematics and the sciences have to do with its close relationship with geometry. However, {{pi}} also appears in many natural situations having apparently nothing to do with geometry. In many applications it plays a distinguished role as an [[eigenvalue]]. For example, an idealized [[vibrating string]] can be modelled as the graph of a function {{math|''f''}} on the unit interval {{math|[0,1]}}, with [[boundary conditions|fixed ends]] {{math|1=''f''(0) = ''f''(1) = 0}}. The modes of vibration of the string are solutions of the [[differential equation]] {{math|1=''f'' "(''x'') + λ ''f''(''x'') = 0}}. Here {{math|λ}} is an associated eigenvalue, which is constrained by [[Sturm–Liouville theory]] to take on only certain specific values. It must be positive, since the second derivative is [[negative definite]], so it is convenient to write {{math|1=λ = &nu;<sup>2</sup>}} where {{math|&nu; > 0}} is called the [[wavenumber]]. Then {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = sin(π ''x'')}} satisfies the boundary conditions and the differential equation with {{math|1=&nu; = π}}.<ref>{{citation |last=Hilbert |first=David |author1link=David Hilbert |last2=Courant |first2=Richard |author2link=Richard Courant |title=Methods of mathematical physics, volume 1 |pages=286&endash;290 |year=1966 |publisher=Wiley}}</ref> The value {{pi}} is in fact the ''least'' such value of the wavenumber, and is associated with the [[fundamental mode]] of vibration of the string. One way to obtain this is by estimating the [[energy]]. The energy satisfies an inequality, [[Wirtinger's inequality for functions]],<ref>{{citation|first1=H. |last1=Dym |first2=H. P. |last2=McKean |title=Fourier series and integrals |publisher=Academic Press |year=1972 |page=47}}</ref> which states that if a function {{math|''f'' : [0, 1] → ℂ}} is given such that {{math|1=''f''(0) = ''f''(1) = 0}} and {{math|''f''}} and {{math|''f'' '}} are both [[square integrable]], then the inequality holds: :<math>\pi^2\int_0^1|f(x)|^2\,dx\le \int_0^1|f'(x)|^2\,dx,</math> and the case of equality holds precisely when {{math|''f''}} is a multiple of {{math|sin(π ''x'')}}. So {{pi}} appears as an optimal constant in Wirtinger's inequality, and from this it follows that it is the smallest such wavenumber, using the [[variational theorem|variational characterization]] of the eigenvalue. As a consequence, {{pi}} is the smallest [[singular value]] of the derivative on the space of functions on {{math|[0,1]}} vanishing at both endpoints (the [[Sobolev space]] <math>H^1_0[0,1]</math>). ===Inequalities=== [[File:Sir William Thompson illustration of Carthage.png|thumb|right|The [[ancient Carthage|ancient city of Carthage]] was the solution to an isoperimetric problem, according to a legend recounted by [[Lord Kelvin]] {{harv|Thompson|1894}}: those lands bordering the sea that [[Dido|Queen Dido]] could enclose on all other sides within a single given oxhide, cut into strips.]] The number {{pi}} serves appears in similar eigenvalue problems in higher-dimensional analysis. As mentioned [[#Definition|above]], it can be characterized via its role as the best constant in the [[isoperimetric inequality]]: the area {{mvar|A}} enclosed by a plane [[Jordan curve]] of perimeter {{mvar|P}} satisfies the inequality :<math>4\pi A\le P^2,</math> and equality is clearly achieved for the circle, since in that case {{math|1=''A'' = π''r''{{sup|2}}}} and {{math|1=''P'' = 2π''r''}}.<ref>{{citation|first=Isaac |last=Chavel |title=Isoperimetric inequalities |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2001}}</ref> Ultimately as a consequence of the isoperimetric inequality, {{pi}} appears in the optimal constant for the critical [[Sobolev inequality]] in ''n'' dimensions, which thus characterizes the role of {{pi}} in many physical phenomena as well, for example those of classical [[potential theory]].<ref>{{citation |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.615.4193&rep=rep1&type=pdf |author=Talenti, Giorgio |title=Best constant in Sobolev inequality |journal=Annali di Matematica Pura ed Applicata |volume=110 |number=1 |pages=353–372 |issn=1618-1891 |doi=10.1007/BF02418013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170129140500/http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.615.4193&rep=rep1&type=pdf |archivedate=29 January 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{citation|title=Best constants in Poincaré inequalities for convex domains|arxiv=1110.2960|author1=L.

This is the [[integral transform]], that takes a complex-valued integrable function {{math|''f''}} on the real line to the function defined as: :<math>\hat{f}(\xi) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x) e^{-2\pi i x\xi}\,dx.</math> There are several different conventions for the Fourier transform, all of which involve a factor of {{pi}} that is placed ''somewhere''.

Furthermore, {{math|4&pi;}} is the surface area of the unit sphere, but we have not assumed that {{mvar|S}} is the sphere. However, as a consequence of the [[divergence theorem]], because the region away from the origin is vacuum (source-free) it is only the [[homology class]] of the surface {{mvar|S}} in {{math|'''R'''<sup>3</sup>\{0} }} that matters in computing the integral, so it can be replaced by any convenient surface in the same homology class, in particular a sphere, where spherical coordinates can be used to calculate the integral.
